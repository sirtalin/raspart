# RaspArt

This project is a web scraper written in Go that obtains an art dataset based in the content of the wiki [WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org/).

## Content Scraped

There are two main features scraped. Scraping the information about the artist and scrapping the information about his artworks. 

In the project [DemocrArt](https://github.com/sirtalin/democrart) is developed an API that facilitates the extraction of the scraped information. 

### Artist

### Artworks

## Future Features

- Improving the content of the dataset by adding more pages to the scraping process.
